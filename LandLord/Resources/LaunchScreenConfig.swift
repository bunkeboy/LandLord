 LAUNCH SCREEN CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
 
 To use the LaunchScreen.storyboard, follow these steps in Xcode:
 
 1. Open your project settings by clicking on the project file in the Project Navigator
 2. Select your app target
 3. Go to the "Info" tab
 4. Find or add the key "UILaunchStoryboardName" and set its value to "LaunchScreen"
 
 Alternatively, if you're using the new project format with Info.plist as source code:
 
 Add this to your Info.plist:
 ```
 <key>UILaunchStoryboardName</key>
 <string>LaunchScreen</string>
 ```
 
 For the coat_of_arms image:
 1. Make sure to add a pixel art coat of arms image to your Assets.xcassets folder
 2. Name it "coat_of_arms" to match the image name in the storyboard
 3. Include 1x, 2x, and 3x versions for different device resolutions
 
 Note: The LaunchScreen.storyboard has been designed to scale properly for all device sizes
 using Auto Layout constraints.
